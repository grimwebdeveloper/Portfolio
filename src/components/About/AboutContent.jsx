          Hi, I'm Sharif — a passionate and self-taught front-end developer who
          believes that{' '}
          <strong className="text-blue-400">skills and consistency matter more than degree</strong>.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          My journey started back in 9th grade during a summer vacation when I
          was first introduced to HTML. Though life took a different path and I
          started preparing for government exams in 2021, destiny had something
          else in store for me.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          In 2022, while doing a computer diploma, I reconnected with web
          development. One of my teachers recognized my potential and advised me
          to pursue this field seriously. But during my job application process,
          I faced corruption not once but three times. That was the turning
          point — I realized I wanted a career where{' '}
          <strong className="text-blue-400">talent, not influence</strong>, decides your success.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          After deep research and recalling my teacher’s advice, I made a bold
          decision in <strong className="text-blue-400">December 2023</strong> — to become a web developer
          and master the skills that truly make an impact.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">My Vision</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          I envision becoming a <strong className="text-blue-400">full-stack creative developer</strong> —
          someone who blends <strong className="text-blue-400">logic with design</strong>, and builds
          smart, stunning, and impactful web experiences.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          My core skill is <strong className="text-blue-400">JavaScript</strong>, and I love using it to
          bring ideas to life across different stacks. I'm always curious,
          exploring new technologies, and staying updated with the latest
          trends.
